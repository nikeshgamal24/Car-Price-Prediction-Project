Thrilled to share insights from a recent hands-on task: tackling outliers in a Car Price Prediction dataset! ðŸ“ˆ

It was a great way to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world scenario.
I started by visually inspecting data for outliers using box plots and analyzing distributions with histograms. 
This guided my decision to use the IQR method for robust outlier detection.

For treatment, I experimented with both trimming (removing extreme values) and capping (replacing them with boundaries) to refine the dataset.

After this, I trained several models, and the KNN model emerged as the top performer, achieving impressive accuracy. 
This task effectively highlighted the critical importance of robust data cleaning for model performance.
